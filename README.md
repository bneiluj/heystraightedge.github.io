## Straightedge: An ethical self-improving smart contract blockchain

Straightedge is a WASM-based smart contract platform built on [Parity Substrate](.
It is a 0-day fork
of the [Edgeware](https://edgewa.re/) blockchain built by
[Commonwealth Labs](https://commonwealth.im/).  The Straightedge blockchain
is being built because we believe in the vision of Edgeware but believe that
the initial distribution mechanisms of the EDGE tokens contains too many edge
cases, that decreases the legitimacy of the entire project.

For this reason, we are planning to launch Straightedge on the 15th of September,
concurrently with the launch of Edgeware, as a 0 day fork, with the same feature set,
but just a slightly changed initital distribution.

The primary changes we propose are:
1) Contract deployers cannot signal on behalf of contracts.
2) No ["generalized locking"](https://blog.edgewa.re/generalized-lock-policy-who-can-appeal-and-how/)
3) Signalled tokens are immediately available in the genesis distribution rather than 1 year later
