## Edgeware: A self-improving smart contract blockchain

Edgeware is a WASM-based smart contract platform. Participants in the
network vote, delegate, and fund each other to improve the network.

Edgeware is launched by [Commonwealth Labs](https://commonwealth.im/)
and built on [Parity Substrate](https://www.parity.io/substrate/).
We're grateful for the support of many friends, advisors, and community
members.
