title: Edgeware
author: Commonwealth Labs

lead1: A self-improving smart contract blockchain
lead2: Edgeware is a high-performance, self-upgrading WASM smart contract platform, in the Polkadot ecosystem.
lead3: Participants vote, delegate, and fund each other to upgrade the network.
lead4: "We are giving away >90% of the network to build a strong initial community. See more:"

intro1: Polkadot's first smart contract chain
intro2: Powered by WebAssembly
intro3: Actively governed, with a treasury
intro4: A pioneer chain in governance

intro5: Once Polkadot is live, Edgeware will be the easiest & simplest way to deploy code to the Polkadot network
intro6: Edgeware smart contracts are written in Rust and executed in WASM, for an order-of-magnitude speedup
intro7: Edgeware's on-chain treasury ensures the protocol will always be funded and maintained, while chain upgrades can be voted in
intro8: Edgeware will be a testbed for mechanisms like on-chain identity, quadratic voting, and modular governance

lockdrop1: The lockdrop
lockdrop2: Edgeware will be launched via a lockdrop, a modified airdrop where participants timelock ETH to receive EDG.
lockdrop3: The lockdrop will take place in Summer 2019, and give away >90% of tokens in the genesis block to participants.
lockdrop4: Lockdroppers will be able to timelock their ETH for 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year. Participants will get 100% of their ETH back afterwards.
lockdrop5: This broad token distribution will bring a wide set of participants into the governance process.
lockdrop6: Lockdrop UI coming soon

stack1: The Edgeware stack
stack2: "Effective on-chain governance requires new tech to be built: DAOs, economic mechanisms, cryptographic voting systems, and interfaces for collaboration."
stack3: Edgeware will build these systems through a process of recursive self-improvement. On-chain governance will be used to choose and fund improvements, and launch them on the network.
