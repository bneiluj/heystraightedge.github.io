    - question: What's the lockdrop?
      answer: |
        To align incentives, the Edgeware network will be launched with a
        lockdrop of EDG tokens to Ether holders. A lockdrop happens where
        token holders on one network timelock their tokens for a certain
        amount of time — all executed within a smart contract. Ether
        holders are able to lock their tokens for as short as 3 months or
        as long as one year. Longer timelocks correspond to proportionally
        more Edgeware tokens.

    - question: Have the lockdrop contracts been audited?
      answer: |
        Audits are ongoing! We will update this FAQ and send out a developer
        update when they are complete.

    - question: Why participate in the lockdrop?
      answer: |
        Many reasons! You can earn fees by validating, experiment with
        building and launching WASM smart contracts, and vote on the
        future of the network.

    - question: Why become a validator?
      answer: |
        Validators help provide security on Edgeware, since it's a
        PoS-based chain. Validators also earn fees from both the block
        reward and transactions. Earned tokens can be used to influence
        further governance decisions on the network.

    - question: How does signaling work?
      answer: |
        There is no bonus for signaling. Instead, there is a deduction of
        40%. Signalers also do not receive their EDG tokens for a year
        after Edgeware's network launch.

    - question: Do lockers and signalers pull from the same allocation pool?
      answer: |
        Signalers and droppers pull from the same allocation pool, the
        4,500,000,000 EDG Tokens that will be allocated to them.

    - question: Why do you want to make people decide between 3, 6 or 12 months?
      answer: |
        Not everyone is able to over come the opportunity cost for locking
        Ethereum for an extended period of time. Having different
        schedules allows people to have different levels of skin in the
        game. A key goal of the Edgeware community is to provide a wide,
        openly participatory network. The lockdrop is a key part of that
        goal.

    - question: How does Edgeware benefit the Ethereum ecosystem?
      answer: |
        We are Ethereum supporters! We also believe Ethereum will benefit
        from the growth of complementary ecosystems.

        1. Lockdrop: The lockdrop will timelock ETH for up to a year
        as people go "long ETH and EDG". Remember, only ETH holders can
        participate! This adds another layer of utility to ETH and lowers
        circulating supply, which will likely enhance the economic
        security of Ethereum as it switches to a Casper-style consensus.

        2. Bridging Networks: We think one of the first proposals that
        the community should work on is a game-theoretically sound ETH-EDG
        bridge. In the long term, this will allows fees and value to both
        to ETH and EDG. With a bridge in place, we anticipate that
        Ethereum dapps/protocols will be able to use Edgeware to scale,
        much in the same way that Loom Network and other protocols help
        scale Ethereum. Similarly, any tokens created on Edgeware can be
        custodied and "moved" over to Ethereum via the bridge, where they
        can be used in Ethereum's \#DeFi network (e.g. traded on 0x,
        collateralized on Maker and Compound, and bundled using Set).

        3. Accelerating Development: Edgeware is be a progressive
        network that will incorporate scaling and governance tech at a
        faster pace than Ethereum, but we expect most of these
        improvements will be backported to Ethereum. We think the net
        effect will be substantially beneficial for both ecosystems. As
        one example, at Commonwealth we are building a multi-chain
        governance tool to make governance on ETH, EDG, or any other chain
        easier, and Edgeware will allow us to test out several governance
        models that we will apply across the ecosystem.

    - question: Is Edgeware a fork of Ethereum?
      answer: |
        No, it's a new chain built on a completely different codebase
        (Parity Substrate) with a different runtime and security model.
        While Ethereum holders can participate in the lockdrop, EDG will
        otherwise be an entirely separate network. However, we anticipate
        that a bridge will be built for ETH-EDG so that both chains can
        work together.

    - question: How do DOTs interact with EDG?
      answer: |
        1. Initially, Edgeware is being launched as an independent chain
        ("solochain"). This means that EDG will be used as the bonding and
        reward token for validators.

        2. When Polkadot launches, Edgeware will be eligible to become a
        parachain. DOTs are used to provide shared security and for
        inter-parachain communication. If and when Edgeware becomes a
        parachain, DOTs instead of EDG will be used as the reward for
        validators. However, EDG will still be used for gas fees and
        spam prevention.

        3. Edgeware uses GRANDPA for finality, the same as consensus. In
        the future, the network may vote to make Edgeware a relay chain,
        just like Polkadot. In this case, EDG may again be used to provide
        security for its own child parachains.

    - question: What happens if Edgeware is no longer a parachain?
      answer: |
        Even if Edgeware is voted off the Polkadot parachain set, it will
        still work as a "solochain", where it's responsible for its own
        security. In that case, EDG validators will have to reboot the
        chain with the chain state at the time Edgeware exited the
        Polkadot relay chain.

    - question: What is Commonwealth Labs' relationship to Edgeware post launch?
      answer: |
        While we're spending time helping launch the chain, once Edgeware
        launches, Commonwealth Labs will participate in governance just as
        any other as a minority token holder.

        We're building a governance UI, anonymous voting modules, and
        other governance tech that we will deploy on Edgeware and other
        networks. We hope that our improvements are voted in by EDG
        holders and implemented on Edgeware!

- section: Technical
  items:
    - question: What are the economics of staking/validating on Edgeware?
      answer: |
        There are initially 5,000,000,000 (five billion) EDG tokens
        minted, divisible up to 18 decimal places. Initially, inflation is
        set to 158 EDG per block.

        This implies approximately 997,220,160 EDG in the first year, or
        just under 20% inflation. The total amount of EDG minted will
        remain the same year after year, causing the percentage
        inflation to be disinflationary, with yearly inflation falling
        to approximately 16.6% in the second year. Additionally, a
        system-wide vote may further increase or decrease
        inflation.

        Half of the inflation will be voted upon by token holders for
        various uses.

    - question: What is Edgeware's consensus mechanism?
      answer: |
        Proof of Stake with GRANDPA finality. More info can be found on
        GRANDPA here:

        https://github.com/paritytech/finality-grandpa

    - question: Who is in the initial validation set?
      answer: |
        Lockdroppers will be able to specify if they want to be part of
        the initial validation set. We hope several hundred individuals
        will choose to do so, although the network will be secure with
        a much smaller validator set.

    - question: How does Edgeware use Parity Substrate?
      answer: |
        Parity Substate allows Edgeware developers to focus on improving
        the chain rather than developing infrastructure.

        Chains launched on Substrate generally do not have to deal with
        network or runtime level engineering changes. They can be
        natively extended with modules, which are written in Rust,
        compiled to Wasm, and linked into the client runtime. Modules
        can be voted into a chain by on-chain governance, at which point
        all clients will automatically download and run them, in a safely
        sandboxed environment.

        This makes the process of upgrading a chain much simpler and
        more accessible to a wide variety of developers!

        Polkadot relay chain.

    - question: What is Commonwealth Labs' relationship to Edgeware post launch?
      answer: |
        While we're spending time helping launch the chain, once Edgeware
        launches, Commonwealth Labs will participate in governance just as
        any other as a minority token holder.

        We're building a governance UI, anonymous voting modules, and
        other governance tech that we will deploy on Edgeware and other
        networks. We hope that our improvements are voted in by EDG
        holders and implemented on Edgeware!

    - question: What are the economics of staking/validating on Edgeware?
      answer: |
        There are initially 5,000,000,000 (five billion) EDG tokens
        minted, divisible up to 18 decimal places. Initially, inflation is
        set to 158 EDG per block.

        This implies approximately 997,220,160 EDG in the first year, or
        just under 20% inflation. The total amount of EDG minted will
        remain the same year after year, causing the percentage
        inflation to be disinflationary, with yearly inflation falling
        to approximately 16.6% in the second year. Additionally, a
        system-wide vote may further increase or decrease
        inflation.

        Half of the inflation will be voted upon by token holders for
        various uses.

    - question: What is Edgeware's consensus mechanism?
      answer: |
        Proof of Stake with GRANDPA finality. More info can be found on
        GRANDPA here:

        https://github.com/paritytech/finality-grandpa

    - question: Who is in the initial validation set?
      answer: |
        Lockdroppers will be able to specify if they want to be part of
        the initial validation set. We hope several hundred individuals
        will choose to do so, although the network will be secure with
        a much smaller validator set.

    - question: How does Edgeware use Parity Substrate?
      answer: |
        Parity Substate allows Edgeware developers to focus on improving
        the chain rather than developing infrastructure.

        Chains launched on Substrate generally do not have to deal with
        network or runtime level engineering changes. They can be
        natively extended with modules, which are written in Rust,
        compiled to Wasm, and linked into the client runtime. Modules
        can be voted into a chain by on-chain governance, at which point
        all clients will automatically download and run them, in a safely
        sandboxed environment.

        This makes the process of upgrading a chain much simpler and
        more accessible to a wide variety of developers!

- section: Lockdrop
  items:
    - question: What's the lockdrop?
      answer: |
        To align incentives, the Edgeware network will be launched with a
        lockdrop of EDG tokens to Ether holders. A lockdrop happens where
        token holders on one network timelock their tokens for a certain
        amount of time — all executed within a smart contract. Ether
        holders are able to lock their tokens for as short as 3 months or
        as long as one year. Longer timelocks correspond to proportionally
        more Edgeware tokens.

    - question: Have the lockdrop contracts been audited?
      answer: |
        Audits are ongoing! We will update this FAQ and send out a developer
        update when they are complete.

    - question: Why participate in the lockdrop?
      answer: |
        Many reasons! You can earn fees by validating, experiment with
        building and launching WASM smart contracts, and vote on the
        future of the network.

    - question: Why become a validator?
      answer: |
        Validators help provide security on Edgeware, since it's a
        PoS-based chain. Validators also earn fees from both the block
        reward and transactions. Earned tokens can be used to influence
        further governance decisions on the network.

    - question: How does signaling work?
      answer: |
        There is no bonus for signaling. Instead, there is a deduction of
        40%. Signalers also do not receive their EDG tokens for a year
        after Edgeware's network launch.

    - question: Do lockers and signalers pull from the same allocation pool?
      answer: |
        Signalers and droppers pull from the same allocation pool, the
        4,500,000,000 EDG Tokens that will be allocated to them.

    - question: Why do you want to make people decide between 3, 6 or 12 months?
      answer: |
        Not everyone is able to over come the opportunity cost for locking
        Ethereum for an extended period of time. Having different
        schedules allows people to have different levels of skin in the
        game. A key goal of the Edgeware community is to provide a wide,
        openly participatory network. The lockdrop is a key part of that
        goal.

- section: Ecosystem
  items:
    - question: How does Edgeware benefit the Ethereum ecosystem?
      answer: |
        We are Ethereum supporters! We also believe Ethereum will benefit
        from the growth of complementary ecosystems.

        1. Lockdrop: The lockdrop will timelock ETH for up to a year
        as people go "long ETH and EDG". Remember, only ETH holders can
        participate! This adds another layer of utility to ETH and lowers
        circulating supply, which will likely enhance the economic
        security of Ethereum as it switches to a Casper-style consensus.

        2. Bridging Networks: We think one of the first proposals that
        the community should work on is a game-theoretically sound ETH-EDG
        bridge. In the long term, this will allows fees and value to both
        to ETH and EDG. With a bridge in place, we anticipate that
        Ethereum dapps/protocols will be able to use Edgeware to scale,
        much in the same way that Loom Network and other protocols help
        scale Ethereum. Similarly, any tokens created on Edgeware can be
        custodied and "moved" over to Ethereum via the bridge, where they
        can be used in Ethereum's \#DeFi network (e.g. traded on 0x,
        collateralized on Maker and Compound, and bundled using Set).

        3. Accelerating Development: Edgeware is be a progressive
        network that will incorporate scaling and governance tech at a
        faster pace than Ethereum, but we expect most of these
        improvements will be backported to Ethereum. We think the net
        effect will be substantially beneficial for both ecosystems. As
        one example, at Commonwealth we are building a multi-chain
        governance tool to make governance on ETH, EDG, or any other chain
        easier, and Edgeware will allow us to test out several governance
        models that we will apply across the ecosystem.

    - question: Is Edgeware a fork of Ethereum?
      answer: |
        No, it's a new chain built on a completely different codebase
        (Parity Substrate) with a different runtime and security model.
        While Ethereum holders can participate in the lockdrop, EDG will
        otherwise be an entirely separate network. However, we anticipate
        that a bridge will be built for ETH-EDG so that both chains can
        work together.

    - question: How do DOTs interact with EDG?
      answer: |
        1. Initially, Edgeware is being launched as an independent chain
        ("solochain"). This means that EDG will be used as the bonding and
        reward token for validators.

        2. When Polkadot launches, Edgeware will be eligible to become a
        parachain. DOTs are used to provide shared security and for
        inter-parachain communication. If and when Edgeware becomes a
        parachain, DOTs instead of EDG will be used as the reward for
        validators. However, EDG will still be used for gas fees and
        spam prevention.

        3. Edgeware uses GRANDPA for finality, the same as consensus. In
        the future, the network may vote to make Edgeware a relay chain,
        just like Polkadot. In this case, EDG may again be used to provide
        security for its own child parachains.

    - question: What happens if Edgeware is no longer a parachain?
      answer: |
        Even if Edgeware is voted off the Polkadot parachain set, it will
        still work as a "solochain", where it's responsible for its own
        security. In that case, EDG validators will have to reboot the
        chain with the chain state at the time Edgeware exited the
        Polkadot relay chain.

    - question: What is Commonwealth Labs' relationship to Edgeware post launch?
      answer: |
