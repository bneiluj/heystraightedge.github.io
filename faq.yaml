    - question: Is there an official whitepaper / manifesto for Straightedge?
      answer: |
        It is in the works, and coming soon!
        Straightedge is derived from the Edgeware project, and the original whitepaper
        is linked here.

        Further, an initial post that delves into the advancements made in Straightedge’s distribution,
        governance and plans for future development will be available soon. 


    - question: What's the inspiration of the fork?
      answer: |
        Edgeware is an exciting new project, and will be one of the first chains launched on Parity’s 
        Substrate platform. While we applaud the testing of a novel form of distribution, (the lockdrop),
        the design of signalling in the Edgeware lockdrop leads to many edge conditions that delegitimize
        the lockdrop and centralizes the initial distribution. To ensure a balanced token model that is
        both legitimate and inclusive of both lockdrop and signal participants, a number of distribution
        improvements have been made prior to genesis.

        1. Remove Signalling on Behalf of Contracts

        2. Remove Generalized Locking

        3. All signalled funds distributed in genesis

    - question: Why is getting the initial distribution right important?
      answer: |
        The initial token distribution is of vital importance to any blockchain project with a viable
        economic model. This is especially true when on-chain systems of governance allow protocol
        level and other changes to be made through the votes and signals of token holders. Should
        an initial token distribution favor certain parties, dominant voting groups and blocks will
        continue to increase their power and distribution over time, shaping the future of any such ecosystem.

    - question: What's the issue with signalling on behalf of contracts?
      answer: |
        Allowing contract deployers to signal on behalf of contracts is a fundamental misunderstanding of
        the premise of smart contracting systems. Smart contracts are meant to be autonomous software that
        are independent of their initial deployer. For example, in the Golem and the Digix project multi-sigs,
        two of the largest in the Ethereum ecosystem, the deployer of the contract isn't even a member of the
        multisig, yet is able to signal on behalf of all of funds. The same is true for many of the largest
        contracts on Ethereum, like the Wrapped Ether (WETH) contract, and we wanted to make this right in Straightedge.


    - question: What's the issue with generalized locking?
      answer: |
        A last minute change called Generalized Locking was added to the Edgeware lockdrop.  It was declared that
        "Generalized Lock" occurs when “an address that calls ‘Signal’ is unable to sign a transaction with
        msg.value greater than 0 for the entirety of the 3, 6 or 12-month lock durations”,
        and in these cases “that signal can be treated as a lock for the purposes of the allocation award”. 

        Because generalized locking only makes sense for contracts, removing the ability to signal
        on behalf of a contract as discussed above removes generalized locking altogether.  However, it is still
        worth explicitly pointing out some of the issues with the policy.  It places undue burden
        upon the launchers of the network to audit and decide on different generalized lock contracts, which
        may contain edge cases such as bypassing locking by issuing derivatives of the locked Ether
        (such as with WETH).  Furthermore, if a contract claiming to be a lock doesn't
        actually act as a lock, but bypasses the launchers of the network by using Underhanded Solidity
        techniques, it could break the legitmacy of the initial distribution of the entire network.


    - question: Were these design decisions made in Edgeware to allow distribution to the victims of locked funds in the November 2017 Parity Multisig Exploit?
      answer: |
        If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.  The Web3 Foundation,
        the largest victim of the Parity bug, has a very close relationship with the Edgeware project, and it is likely it 
        is due to the influence of the Web3 Foundation that these odd design decisions were made in the construction of the
        Edgeware lockdrop.  In order to recover their own lost funds, they likely pushed for design decisions that threaten
        the legitmacy of the Edgeware project as a whole.

        An open system of governance is one in which the people deserve a say, and a system in which
        rules are changed to provide select parties with powerful voting shares is not open.
        In the case of Edgeware, the potential for an open-future was extinguished prior to launch by
        late-stage changes to a token distribution model that aimed to artificially provide favor to a
        small, select group of individuals and teams through what was labeled a “generalized lock”.
        This change alone provided an extremely high amount of all network-tokens to a party or parties not in control
        of the funds for which tokens are rewarded. 

        Nonetheless, because the Web3 Foundation's support in funding the development of Parity Substrate, the framework upon
        which Straightedge is built, is undeniable, possible ways of rewarding them would be to use the on-chain governance process
        of Straightedge to reward the locked funds from the Parity wallets with the equivalent amount of Straightedge they would have
        earned if it has been a successful signal.  This will allow the Web3 Foundation to successfully execute on its goal of recovering
        value from their locked funds, but doing so in a way that protects the legitimacy of the project by putting the issue to the 
        governance of Straightedge tokenholders and ecosystem participants.

        
        
        If rejected by governance, the receiver of the 10% founder's reward can also optionally
        choose to share their cut with the Web3 Foundation or Parity if they so see fit.

    - question: What is a zero-day fork?
      answer: |
        A zero-day fork is a novel type of fork in which two alternative implementations of a project
        are launched at the exact same time, on a brand new network. Both Straightedge and Edgeware
        are slated for launch on September 15, 2019. Thus far, in major network forks, we've seen both
        the incumbent network gain market superiority (in the case of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash) and
        the challenger network gain superiority (in the case of Ethereum Classic and Ethereum). It will
        be an interesting experiment in governance to see the results of what happens in a zero-day
        fork that launches two networks at the same time.


    - question: What if I want to learn more about the lockdrop or technical details?
      answer: |
        Please review the Edgeware FAQs where you can learn more about the lockdrop contracts,
        the Straightedge software, and incentives for validation.
