    - question: Is there an official whitepaper / manifesto for Straightedge?
      answer: |
        It is in the works, and coming soon!

    - question: What's the inspiration of the fork?
      answer: |
        Edgeware is an exciting new project being one of the first chains
        to be launched on the Parity Substrate platform and is testing a novel
        form of distribution, a lockdrop.  However, the design of the signalling
        in the Edgeware lockdrop leads to many edge conditions that break the
        legitiamacy of the lockdrop and leads to a less fair initial distribution.
        To ensure a balanced token model that is both legitimate and  inclusive of
        all lockdrop and signal participants, a number of distribution improvements
        have been made prior to genesis.

        1. Remove Signalling on Behalf of Contracts

        2. Remove Generalized Locking

        3. All signalled funds distributed in genesis


    - question: What's the issue with signalling on behalf of contracts?
      answer: |
        Allowing contract deployers to signal on behalf of contracts is a fundamental
        misunderstanding of the premise of smart contracting systems.  Smart contracts
        are meant to be autonomous software that are independent of their initial deployer.
        Allowing deployers to signal on behalf of smart contracts leads to many weird edge cases.
        For example, in the the Golem project multisig
        and the Digix project multisig,
        two of the largest multisigs in Ethereum, the deployer of the contract isn't even a member
        of the multisig, yet is able to signal on behalf of all of their Ether.  Same goes for many
        of the largest contracts.  For example, the deployer of WETH can signal on behalf of all Wrapped Ether.

    - question: What's the issue with generalized locking?
      answer: |
        Once removing the ability to signal on behalf of contracts, generalized locking becomes a non-issue.
        However, it is still useful to point out some of the issues with the policy.  It places undue burden
        upon the launchers of the network to audit and decide on different generalized lock contracts, which
        may contain edge cases such as bypassing locking by issuing derivatives of the locked Ether
        (such as with WETH).  Furthermore, if a contract claiming to be a lock doesn't
        actually act as a lock, but bypasses the launchers of the network by using Underhanded Solidity
        techniques, it could break the legitmacy of the initial distribution of the entire network.

    - question: Were these design decisions made in Edgeware to allow distribution to the victims of locked funds in the November 2017 Parity Multisig Attack?
      answer: |
        If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.  The Web3 Foundation,
        the largest victim of the Parity bug, has a very close relationship with the Edgeware project, and it is likely it 
        is due to the influence of the Web3 Foundation that these odd design decisions were made in the construction of the
        Edgeware lockdrop.  In order to recover their own lost funds, they likely pushed for design decisions that threaten
        the legitmacy of the Edgeware project as a whole.

        Nonetheless, because the Web3 Foundation's support in funding the development of Parity Substrate, the framework upon
        which Straightedge is built, is undeniable, possible ways of rewarding them would be to use the on-chain governance process
        of Straightedge to reward the locked funds from the Parity wallets with the equivalent amount of Straightedge they would have
        earned if it has been a successful signal.  If rejected by governance, the receiver of the 10% founder's reward can optionally
        choose to share their cut with the Web3 Foundation or Parity if they so see fit.

    - question: What is a zero-day fork?
      answer: |
        A zero-day fork is a novel type of fork in which two alternative forks are launched at the exact same time,
        on a brand new network.  Both Edgeware and Straightedge are slated for launch on September 15, 2019.
        Thus far, in major network forks, we've seen both the incumbent network gain
        market superiority (in the case of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash) and the challenger network gain superiority
        (in the case of Ethereum Classic and Ethereum).  It will be an interesting experiment in governance to see
        the results of what happens in a zero-day fork that launches two networks at the same time.  

    - question: What if I want to learn more about the lockdrop or technical details?
      answer: |
        Please take a look at the Edgeware FAQs where you can learn more about the lockdrop
        contracts, the Straightedge software, and incentives for validation.
