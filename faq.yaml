    - question: What's the lockdrop?
      answer: |
        To align incentives, the Edgeware network will be launched
        with a lockdrop of EDG tokens to Ether holders. A lockdrop
        happens where token holders on one network timelock their
        tokens for a certain amount of time using a smart
        contract. For the Edgeware lockdrop, ETH holders may lock
        their tokens for as short as 3 months or as long as one
        year. Longer timelocks correspond to proportionally more
        EDG received.

    - question: Have the lockdrop contracts been audited?
      answer: |
        Yes, please see the following Quantstamp audit of the Lockdrop
        Master Contract:

    - question: Why participate in the lockdrop?
      answer: |
        Many reasons! You can earn fees as a validator, deploy WASM
        smart contracts to experiment with cutting-edge technology,
        and vote on the future of the network.

    - question: Why become a validator?
      answer: |
        Validators help provide security on Edgeware, since it's a
        PoS-based chain. Validators also earn fees from both the block
        reward and transactions. Earned tokens can be used to influence
        further governance decisions on the network.

    - question: How does signaling work?
      answer: |
        There is no bonus for signaling. Instead, there is a deduction of
        80%. Signalers receive 25% of their tokens upfront, and only
        receive the remaining 75% a year after the network launches.

    - question: Do lockers and signalers pull from the same allocation pool?
      answer: |
        Signalers and droppers pull from the same allocation pool, the
        4,500,000,000 EDG Tokens that will be allocated to them.

    - question: Why do you want to make people decide between 3, 6 or 12 months?
      answer: |
        Not everyone is able to over come the opportunity cost for locking
        Ethereum for an extended period of time. Having different
        schedules allows people to have different levels of skin in the
        game. A key goal of the Edgeware community is to provide a wide,
        openly participatory network. The lockdrop is a key part of that
        goal.

    - question: How does Edgeware benefit the Ethereum ecosystem?
      answer: |
        We are Ethereum supporters! We also believe Ethereum will benefit
        from the growth of complementary ecosystems.

        1. Lockdrop: The lockdrop will timelock ETH for up to a year
        as people go "long ETH and EDG". Since only ETH holders can
        participate, this supports the utility of ETH and lowers
        circulating supply, enhancing economic security of Ethereum
        as well as its role as a cryptocurrency.

        2. Bridging Networks: We think one of the first proposals that
        the community should work on is a game-theoretically sound
        ETH-EDG bridge. In the long term, this will allow fees and
        value to accrue to both ETH and EDG holders. With a bridge in
        place, we anticipate that Ethereum dapps/protocols will be
        able to use Edgeware to scale, in the same way that Loom
        Network and other protocols help scale Ethereum. Similarly,
        any tokens created on Edgeware can be custodied and "moved"
        over to Ethereum via the bridge, where they can be used in
        Ethereum's #DeFi ecosystem (e.g. traded on 0x and dy/dx,
        collateralized on Maker and Compound, and bundled using Set).

        3. Accelerating Development: Edgeware is a progressive
        network that will incorporate scaling and governance tech at a
        faster pace than Ethereum. We do expect most of these
        improvements will be backported to Ethereum, and that the net
        effect will be substantially beneficial for both ecosystems. As
        one example, at Commonwealth we are building a multi-chain
        governance tool to make governance on ETH, EDG, or any other chain
        easier, and Edgeware will allow us to test out several governance
        models that we will apply across the ecosystem.

    - question: Is Edgeware a fork of Ethereum?
      answer: |
        No, it's a new chain built on a completely different codebase
        (Substrate) with a different runtime and security model.
        While Ethereum holders can participate in the lockdrop, EDG
        will otherwise be an entirely separate network. However, we
        anticipate that a bridge will be built for ETH-EDG so that
        both chains can work together.

    - question: How do DOTs interact with EDG?
      answer: |
        1. Initially, Edgeware is being launched as an independent chain
        ("solochain"). This means that EDG will be used as the bonding and
        reward token for validators.

        2. When Polkadot launches, Edgeware will be eligible to become
        a parachain. DOTs are used to provide shared security and for
        inter-parachain communication in the Polkadot Network, so if
        and when Edgeware becomes a parachain, DOT instead of EDG will
        be used as the reward for validators instead. However, EDG
        will still be used for gas fees, spam prevention, and bonding
        for on-chain activities (e.g. governance).

        3. In the future, the network may vote to make Edgeware a
        relay chain, just like Polkadot. In this case, EDG may be used
        to provide security for child parachains.

    - question: What happens if Edgeware is no longer a parachain?
      answer: |
        Even if Edgeware is voted off the Polkadot parachain set, it will
        still work as a "solochain", where it's responsible for its own
        security. In that case, EDG validators will have to reboot the
        chain with the chain state at the time Edgeware exited the
        Polkadot relay chain.

    - question: What is Commonwealth Labs' relationship to Edgeware post launch?
      answer: |
        While we're helping to launch the chain, after Edgeware
        launches, Commonwealth Labs will participate in governance
        just like any other minority token holder.

        We're building a governance UI, anonymous voting modules, and
        other governance tech that we will deploy on Edgeware and other
        networks. We hope that our improvements are voted in by EDG
        holders and implemented on Edgeware!

  items:
    - question: What are the economics of staking/validating on Edgeware?
      answer: |
        There are initially 5,000,000,000 (five billion) EDG tokens
        minted, divisible up to 18 decimal places. Initially, inflation is
        set to 158 EDG per block.

        This implies approximately 997,220,160 EDG in the first year,
        or just under 20%. The total amount of EDG minted will remain
        constant, causing the percentage inflation per year to be
        disinflationary, with yearly inflation falling to
        approximately 16.6% in the second year. Additionally, a
        system-wide vote may further increase or decrease inflation.

        Initially, half of the inflation will be allocated to the
        on-chain treasury which may be upon by token holders for
        various uses.

    - question: What is Edgeware's consensus mechanism?
      answer: |
        Proof of Stake with GRANDPA finality. More info can be found on
        GRANDPA here:

        https://github.com/paritytech/finality-grandpa

    - question: Who is in the initial validation set?
      answer: |
        Lockdroppers will be able to specify if they want to be part
        of the initial validation set. We hope a substantial number
        will choose to do so, although we expect the network will be
        secure with a smaller validator set.

    - question: How does Edgeware use Parity Substrate?
      answer: |
        Parity Substate allows Edgeware developers to focus on improving
        the chain rather than developing infrastructure.

        Chains launched on Substrate generally do not have to deal with
        network or runtime level engineering changes. They can be
        natively extended with modules, which are written in Rust,
        compiled to Wasm, and linked into the client runtime. Modules
        can be voted into a chain by on-chain governance, at which point
        all clients will automatically download and run them, in a safely
        sandboxed environment.

        This makes the process of upgrading a chain much simpler and
        more accessible to a wide variety of developers!
